# FAQ

## How can I change the conference title?

The conference title is defined for all the languages in the corresponding sub-section of the [Parameters](README.md#parameters) section.

## How can I set two subtitles?

You can type a HTML code in the subtitle field (in the "Parameters" section for the corresponding langauge). So you can type something like:
```html
Conference in honnor of professor Tournesol<br><span class="subsubtitle">Lille, from 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>th</sup> June 1944
```
And then if you want to change the style of the `subsubtitle` class you can do it in some `.css` [file](files.md).

## How can I change the editor setting?

To display the list of settings you have to press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd> (or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd> on Mac) inside the text area. Then you can change the theme, the keybindings and so on.

## How can I upload files (images,pdfs...) to mathconf?

You can't. Network traffic and data storage come at a price, and I don't want to incur those expenses. You must use external services to store these elements and then use the provided links. Here are some examples of such services:

- [imgur.com](https://imgur.com/) can be used to store `jpg` and `png` files by simple "drag and drop".
- [svgur.com](https://svgur.com/) like `imgur.com` but for `svg` images.
- Git repos like [GitHub](https://www.github.com) or [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com) can be used to store and serve  any kind of content.
- Your personal webpage can be used to store and serve any type of files.
- Cloud file services like [Mega](https://mega.io/), [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)... can be used to store and serve any type of files.
