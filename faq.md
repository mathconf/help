# FAQ

## How can I change the conference title?

The conference title is defined for all the languages in the corresponding sub-section of the [Parameters](README.md#parameters) section.

## How can I set two subtitles?

You can type a HTML code in the subtitle field (in the "Parameters" section for the corresponding langauge). So you can type something like :
```html
Conference in honnor of professor Tournesol<br><span class="subsubtitle">Lille, from 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>th</sup> June 1944
```
And then if you want to change the style of the `subsubtitle` class you can do it in some `.css` [file](files.md).
